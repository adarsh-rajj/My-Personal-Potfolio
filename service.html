                    <h2>Full Stack Development</h2>
                        <p>Instead of hiring some back-end and front-end developers, an engineering team can recruit full-stack web developers who can work well with both client and server sides, or separately back-end and front-end developers. Such programmers need to master the latest front-end languages (e.g. React.JS or Angular) and back end technologies (e.g. Ruby on Rails or .NET).  </p>

                        <p>Amazon profited from the Covid-19 crisis with an increase of 26% in net sales during the first quarter. Indeed, the needs of online shopping are always increasing, even not in quarantine time. So e-commerce web development is also separately provided.  </p>

                    <h2>Customized web app development </h2>
                        <p>The difference between webs and web apps is quite vague. The latter can be understood as apps working on any web servers with higher user interaction, typically Google Apps, Facebook, or Netflix. Some top companies like MobiDev (based in Atlanta, the USA) use prevalent technologies such as PHP, Ruby, Python & Go or JavaScript for website back-end and front-end development.   </p>
